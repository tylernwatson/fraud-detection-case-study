# Fraud Detection Case Study

For the next two days you will deal with the entire end to end pipeline of data science through a case study.  We have touched on aspects of this throughout the course but have not yet put all the pieces together in a single case study.

The data is in that directory, under `files/data.zip`. You can uncompress the data file with this command: `unzip data.zip`.

## Themes you will be assessed on

* Software best practices (proper encapsulation and functions)
* Product focus
* Deployed model(s)
* Project scoping -- independence

## Rough timeline 

* Day 1: Project scoping, Model building, and an intro to Web apps
* Day 2: Web app and deployment

## Deliverables

* Model (properly commented and encapsulated on Github with a readme)
* Exposed API
* Data visualization (extra)

## Notes

* [Here](notes.md) are some notes on how to get started with the dataset and how to save your model once you've trained it.

## Exercise

* Follow the steps in the [exercise file](instructions.md).
